#Part 3 

JavaScript Enhancements: 

2.1. Interactive Elements: 

I researched and implemented interactive elements like accordions, tabs, or modals to enhance user experience (using jQuery or other possible JavaScript frameworks). 
I created interactive maps using libraries like Leaflet, Mapbox, OpenLayers, or Google Maps API to create location-based features. 
I added animations and transitions using CSS and JavaScript. 
I explored and implemented advanced DOM manipulation techniques to create dynamic web pages. 
I implemented a gallery with a lightbox to display images in a larger view when clicked. 

2.2. Dynamic Content: 

I used JavaScript to dynamically load content, such as posts or product listings. 
I implemented a search functionality to filter and sort content (either on services, products, or the events page). 
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 

3.1 On-Page SEO: 

• Title Tags and Meta Descriptions: I wrote compelling title tags and meta descriptions for each page. 
• Header Tags: I used heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to structure my content. 
• Image Optimisation: I used descriptive file names and alt text for images. 
• URL Structure: I created clean and descriptive URLs. 
• Internal Linking: I linked to relevant pages within my website. 
• Mobile-Friendliness: I ensured my website is mobile-friendly. 
 
3.2 Off-Page SEO: 

• Social Media: I promoted my website on social media platforms. 
• Local SEO: I optimised my website for local search if applicable. 
 
3.3 Additional Requests: 

Robots.txt: I created a robots.txt file to instruct search engine crawlers on which pages to index. 
Sitemap.xml: I created a sitemap to help search engines understand the structure of my website. 
Page Speed: I optimised my website's loading speed. 
Security: I implemented security measures to protect my website from attacks. 
Form Functionality and Validation 

4.1. HTML Form: 

As noted in the instructions in Part 1, I was required to include a form on both the enquiry.html and contact.html webpages. While the forms may be similar, the difference in purpose should be noted. 

enquiry.html: This form allows the user to enquire about the services, products, or the possibility of becoming a volunteer or sponsor, depending on the storyline I have chosen. Once the input has been validated, the information should be processed and present the user with a response related to the cost, availability, or another relevant aspect. contact.html: This form should allow the user to submit information for a general message being sent to the organisation. The input should request basic contact information, the type of message being sent, with the allowance to type a full message. This information, once validated, should be compiled and included into an email, and the customer/client should be able to send the email to the recipient stated in the code. 

Form Elements: I used appropriate HTML form elements (input, textarea, select, etc.) to collect user information. 
Form Validation: I used HTML5 form validation attributes or JavaScript to validate user input, including formats of specific types of input (phone numbers, dates, character lengths, etc.). 
Form Submission: I used the form element's action attribute to specify the URL where the form data will be sent. 

JavaScript Form Validation: 

Client-Side Validation: I used JavaScript to validate form data before submission. 
Error Handling: I displayed error messages to the user if the form data is invalid. 
AJAX Form Submission: I used AJAX to submit form data asynchronously, providing a better user experience.
